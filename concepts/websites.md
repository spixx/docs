# Websites
## Preamble
For the longest of times I have been pondering how I should put myself in the
so called build pipeline. As a technician there is seldom any entry points into
the world of CI/CD. But alas I have found a good way of achieving this in my own
way. So since no one ever reads anything on my websites they shall be on the
sharp end of my experimental pipeline.

## Technology
To ensure easy transitions between different providers the following should be
considered:

 * running on containers
 * keeping to simple host-machines
 * using an automation tool to ensure cohesion
 * simple methods of creating websites

Hosting will be at [Hosthatch](http://hosthatch.com) for the first year then a
migration will be taking place over to [Digitalocean](http://digitalocean.com).

### Containers
Since the industry standard seems to be Docker containers this shall be the
choice for this particular technology. But in the interest of future Internet
historians; the choice is simple since it is more portable, widely used and I
have prior experience with it.

### Automation
